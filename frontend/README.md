# English Learning App

## Description

A simple English learning app for kids and adults. From czech language only.

## Explanation

No one I know learned English from school. Everyone learned through repeated exposure by reading or listening.

Language is not math. People donâ€™t learn by calculating sentences from grammatical rules. Words and sentences arise from the subconscious naturally and are pushed into the subconscious through repetition.

This app focuses on maximizing daily repetitions.

## Principles

- **Repetition**: Practice up to 1,000 words and sentences per hour.
- **Speaking**: Prioritize listening and speaking. Everyone struggles with speaking, so why focus on anything else?
- **No writing**: Writing slows down repetitions, and automatic grammar correction is here to stay.
- **Paralysis-Free**: One "Practice" button. Nothing else. No paralysis about what to do next. Anytime you have half a minute, do some repetition. App will start with individual words and slowly will incorporate grammar and sentences.
